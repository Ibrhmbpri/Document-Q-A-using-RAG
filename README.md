# AI-Powered Document Q&A Assistant

An AI-powered Question & Answer (Q&A) assistant that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content in natural language.

## Features
- Upload and analyze PDF documents.
- Ask questions in natural language and get AI-generated answers.
- Uses **Mistral-7B-Instruct** for text generation and **all-MiniLM-L6-v2** for embeddings.
- Secure handling of API keys via `.env` file.
- Optimized for performance with GPU support (if available).
